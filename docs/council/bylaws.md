# Guild Council Guidelines

The guild council serves as the backbone of our leadership structure, ensuring fair decision-making and maintaining the guild’s goals and values. This document outlines the composition, responsibilities, and processes that govern the council.

---

## 1. Council Composition and Responsibilities

The guild council consists of **five members** who collaborate to make important decisions for the guild. Council members are expected to:
- Represent the best interests of all guild members.
- Maintain fair and respectful discussions.
- Uphold the guild's goals and values.

Council decisions require a quorum of at least **three members** to move forward, ensuring balanced and well-represented outcomes.

---

## 2. Quorum Requirements

A **quorum** is the minimum number of council members required to conduct official business and make binding decisions. For our council:
- A quorum is defined as at least **three out of five council members**.
- Without a quorum, no official decisions or votes can be made, and discussions will remain informal.

If a quorum cannot be met due to unforeseen circumstances, the **Steward** will reschedule the meeting at the earliest convenience. This ensures all decisions represent a broad and fair perspective.

---

## 3. The Role of the Steward

The **Steward** is a special council role, elected by council members, responsible for:
- Facilitating votes and moderating discussions.
- Scheduling meetings and ensuring productive dialogue.
- Maintaining a respectful and fair environment during debates.

The Steward does not hold additional decision-making power but acts as the organizer to support efficient council operations.

---

## 4. Decision-Making and Voting

For a decision to pass:
- It must receive a **majority vote** (at least 3 out of 5 votes).
- Discussions will be open to all council members, with each member given equal time to share their views.
- Votes can be cast openly or anonymously if agreed upon by the council.

Results of all decisions will be communicated transparently to guild members.

---

## 5. Conducting Debates

Council debates should remain respectful and focused on the issues at hand. Guidelines for debates include:
- Each council member may share their perspective without interruption.
- The **Steward** moderates discussions, ensuring fair participation and preventing domination by any individual.
- If discussions become heated, the Steward may call for a **cool-down period** to allow members to reflect calmly.

---

## 6. Removal of Council Members

Council members may be removed for the following reasons:
- Failure to uphold responsibilities.
- Actions against the guild’s interests.
- Consistent disruption of the decision-making process.

Removal requires:
- A vote from the remaining council members, with at least **three votes in favor** of removal.
- Automatic removal for **inactivity over one month** without prior notice or explanation.

---

## 7. Replacement of Council Members

If a council member is removed, resigns, or becomes inactive:
- Remaining council members will nominate replacements from the guild’s active and contributing members.
- A vote will be held, requiring a **majority vote** (3 out of 5) to appoint the new member.
- The newly appointed member will serve until the next election cycle or the end of the replaced member’s term.

---

## 8. Voting Procedures

Voting follows a clear and structured process:
- All votes require a **quorum of three members present**.
- Votes occur after open discussion of the topic, with each member having **one vote**.
- In the event of a tie, the **Steward** casts the deciding vote.

If a quorum cannot be met, the meeting will be rescheduled.

---

## 9. Transparency and Communication

Transparency is key to maintaining trust between the council and guild members:
- Council decisions, discussions, and voting results will be shared openly with the guild.
- Regular council meetings will occur **monthly** (or more frequently as needed).
- Summaries of meetings will be posted for guild members to review.

---

These guidelines ensure the guild council operates effectively, transparently, and in alignment with the guild’s values, fostering a fair and collaborative environment for all members.
