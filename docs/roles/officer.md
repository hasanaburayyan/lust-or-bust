# Officer Role

The **Officer** role supports the guild by managing specific duties assigned by the **Council** and **Raid Leader**, ensuring smooth day-to-day operations. Officers act as trusted representatives of the guild’s leadership, offering guidance and assistance to members while fostering a positive and enjoyable guild environment. All **Council Members** inherently hold the Officer role but may have additional responsibilities tied to their Council duties.

- Strong **communication** and **interpersonal skills**.
- A willingness to dedicate time to assist with guild operations as needed.

## Role Scope and Autonomy

Officers have the autonomy to:
