# Raid Leader Role

The **Raid Leader** is a dedicated position within the guild, distinct from **Officer** and **Council Member** roles. While an officer or council member may also serve as a Raid Leader, it is not implied that the Raid Leader holds either of these positions by default.

The Raid Leader is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the guild's raid activities. They have full authority over raid operations, ensuring organized, efficient, and successful raids. Operating independently within their scope, the Raid Leader makes decisions on roster composition, raid strategies, and player assignments without requiring council approval. This role focuses on maintaining high performance and fostering a positive raiding environment.
